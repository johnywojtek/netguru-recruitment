# Junior front-end task

Hey there!

Thanks for joining recruitment for Junior Front-end dev @ netguru. We’ve a small task for you!

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netguru/junior-frontend-recruitment-task/master/imgs/preview.png)

This is simple Radio widget (you can find PSD from [Alexander Zaytsev](https://dribbble.com/anwaltzzz) in [psds](https://github.com/netguru/junior-frontend-recruitment-task/tree/master/psds) directory). Can you make this stuff work?

Use [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) as playground (create an account and create new pen, once you’re done send us link to your work). You can use any different platform if you want, (for example [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com)), but please remember that:
+ your widget should work out of the box (we should click link and be able to use it)
+ we should be able to take a look at your code :)

### Rules & hints
1. We love Sass, ES6, HAML. Using CSS prepprocessor (Sass with SCSS syntax strongly preffered) is a must, the rest is nice to have. CoffeeScript is welcome as well.
2. Widget is mostly static - selecting station is the only action available. After selecting station it should toggle it and display its name at the bottom of the widget.
3. Rest of the buttons should be clickable but it should trigger no action.
4. Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc.
5. You can find cropped images in images directory, but you don't have to use all of them (CSS power!).
6. Remember about users with retina screens.

**Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ping us!**
